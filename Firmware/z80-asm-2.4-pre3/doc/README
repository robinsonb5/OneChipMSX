In few sentences: Z80-asm is a C-source code availible package which contains
a 2-pass Z80 assembler and a sofisticated Z80 monitor. This monitor can be used
as debugger, disassembler, emulator and more for a Z80-CPU.
The hardware supported is in principle only the raw CPU with 64 kB memory
(optional with bank switching) and the quartz --- thus independendly of any
real operating system. But there exists already some add-ons, like 
LCD-display, direct keyboard access, daisy-chain interrupt-logic and even a
(probably buggy) Z80-CTC emulation.

We hope you have fun ...
